# VRChat Utilites & Assets
This repo contains various scripts and assets I've created to make content creation for VRChat a more streamlined process.

## Avatars

### Scene Config

## Worlds

### Desktop Hands
Desktop Hands is a way for desktop users to be able to hold out their right hand and "control" it in a sense.

**HOW TO:** Place the prefab in your world.
When you pick it up it will stick to your hand and disable the mesh renderer.
When you release it the mesh renderer will activate again.
